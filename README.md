# Bike Rental System
The SP4RK bike rental system was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, playing a key role in managing data. The system offers features such as bike reservations, user management, analytics, and rental tracking. It is designed to be scalable, flexible, and efficient, catering to the needs of both customers and the company. Through the use of NoSQL technology, CYKEL can now automate its rental operations, gain deeper insights from data, and improve customer experience.
